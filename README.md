# Stein Variational Newton Nerual Network Ensembles

This repo contains the implementation for the paper "Stein Variational Newton Nerual Network Ensembles" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01887). Please refer to the paper for a detailed description of our approach and experimental information.

## Why Stein Variational Newton Methods?

The SVN method, introduced in "Stein Variational Newton Method" (Liu et al., 2018, https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03085), and its stochastic extension, sSVN, as detailed in "Stochastic Stein Variational Newton Method" (Detommaso et al., 2022, https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09039), represent a significant advancement in the field of Bayesian deep learning. These methods combine the strengths of Stein's method with Newton's approach to optimize the variational objective, facilitating more accurate and efficient inference by considering the curvature of the loss landscape, which is crucial for deep learning models.

The incorporation of the Python Laplace library, inspired by "Laplace Redux â€“ Effortless Bayesian Deep Learning" (Daxberger et al., 2021, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14806.pdf), enables efficient computation of the Hessian, further enhancing the practicality and scalability of our approach to Bayesian deep learning.

## Our Contribution: SVN and sSVN Ensembles

The SVN method offers a compelling advantage by incorporating second-order information, such as Hessians, into the optimization process, thereby accelerating and generalizing the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm. This second-order information is crucial for capturing the curvature of the target distribution, leading to faster convergence and more accurate approximation of the posterior distribution. Our repository extends these foundational works by applying SVN and sSVN methods to deep learning ensembles. This approach not only improves predictive performance but also offers the following benefits:

- **Enhanced Uncertainty Quantification:**: By leveraging Bayesian principles, our method provides a more principled way to estimate uncertainty, which is critical for high-stakes applications like healthcare and autonomous driving.
- **Robustness to Overfitting**: The ensemble approach, combined with Bayesian inference, naturally guards against overfitting, making our method suitable for complex datasets with intricate patterns.
- **Adaptability to Complex Dynamics**: The use of second-order information makes our method particularly adept at capturing complex dynamics, making it ideal for tasks where such details are crucial for predictive accuracy.
Beyond SVN: Implementing SVGD and Deep Ensembles

In addition to SVN and sSVN, our repository also implements Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) and Deep Ensembles, offering a comprehensive suite of tools for Bayesian deep learning. SVGD provides a bridge between variational inference and MCMC, allowing for efficient approximation of posterior distributions, while Deep Ensembles offer a straightforward yet effective means to enhance model performance and uncertainty estimation.

## Applications and Impact

Our implementation is designed to be versatile, catering to both regression and classification tasks across various domains. It is especially beneficial for applications where understanding the uncertainty and capturing second-order dynamics can significantly impact decision-making processes. By advancing the state-of-the-art in Bayesian inference for deep learning, we aim to contribute to the development of more reliable, accurate, and interpretable AI systems.
